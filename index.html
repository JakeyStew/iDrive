				<h2>About iDrive/Me</h2>
                <h3>About Me </h3>
                    <p>I have been an approved driving instructor for a decade now (10 years) and have attained a high pass rate from my students over the last years. I believe I am an experienced and friendly instructor who can easily be approached with questions or concerns for their children or themselves. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During my lessons I feel I provide a relaxed atmosphere to help students ease into the driving experience which helps them learn and progress more quickly and at their own pace if needed. This results in students performing much more sensibly and too much delight passing their tests first time round!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Over the years I have slowly built a reputation amongst my previous and current students who have referred their friends and family to me, which is evident that my teaching style is professional and friendly. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I work multiple hours a day and i'm flexible with people’s schedules when learning to drive, this allows them to fit my lessons into their own personal schedules, this allows me to fit lessons around my day as well as your own benefiting both parties and gives you the chance to decide when you wish to drive and learn. I cater for all types of people such as those that wish to boost their confidence or those that want a refresher on driving.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently I am driving the all new Skoda Fabia Monte Carlo in Red/Black which you might occasionally see driving around the Newport area. I feel this car is ideal for students to learn in.

				<h2>F.A.Q</h2>
				<h4><li>What are the costs of each driving lesson?</li></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>The normal rate is at £20 per hour, however the first two lessons are half price, with lessons being at £18 per hour if you book 10 lessons in bulk for £180.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h4><li>Can I get lessons in an automatic car?</li></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Currently all lessons will be taken in a manual Skoda.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h4><li>I have an automatic license can i drive a manual car?</li></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Short answer no. If you have a licence to drive an automatic car you must take another test in a manual car before you can drive it alone. You can use your automatic licence as a provisional manual licence and drive a manual car displaying L plates but you must have a suitably qualified driver by your side.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h4><li>Do you have a female instructor?</li></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>No, I currently work alone, Although I fully understand that some people prefer the idea of having a female instructor. Bear in mind that what you need is a good reliable instructor whether male or female.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h4><li>What are the manoeuvres?</li></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are five possible manoeuvres, you will normally be asked to perform only one of them on test, although you could be asked to do more. They are: 1. The turn in the road (often referred to as the three point turn). 2. The left reverse (reversing around a corner on your left). 3. The right the reverse (reversing around a corner on your right, this manoeuvre is useful for people driving vans). 4. The parallel park. 5. The bay park.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
				<h4><li>How do I book my theory/practical test?</li></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>You can do this by clicking the link in the upper right hand corner of the website. Simply follow the link and then the instrucitons on the relating pages.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h4><li>Will I need to provide my own car for the practical test?</li></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>No, the car you learned to drive in will be provided for you, however you are allowed to use your own car if you have one and are insured to use it under supervision.		</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h4><li>How do I pay for my lessons?</li></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Currently I only accept cash and cheques, which can be paid before or after lessons.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>		
                <h4><li>What do I need to take to my theory/practical test?</li></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>*Please Read Carefully* You will need to bring both parts of your driving licence - the photocard and the paper counterpart. And for your practical test you will need your theory test pass certificate (or confirmation) if you’re not exempt from taking the theory test and both parts of your driving licence - the photocard and the paper counterpart. 		</p>
